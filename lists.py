# Basics of working with lists

fruits = ["Apple","Orange","Grape","Watermelon","Strawberry"]
# index      0       1        2        3             4
# reverse   -5      -4       -3       -2            -1
apple = ["Apple","red", 4]

print(fruits)
print(apple)

# Printing by its index value
print(fruits[1])

# Printing values from backwards. Starts from -1, -2, -3 and so on
print(fruits[-2])

# Printing values from index to all after that
print(fruits[2:])

# Printing values using the range
print(fruits[2:4])
